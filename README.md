# Bioinformatics-Specialization
Practices from Coursera courses

Its been two years from day I started this course

The Course had various logics and algorithms, but I was not having
much knowledge on those topics, But with the extensive day and night learning 
journey, I feel somewhat confident with the capacity of knowledge, based on the things I explored in these years
